TODO: 
- Write functions to compare what is in the DB to what the API returns.
  -> For each game's price data prices need to be compared. The lowest sale price should be saved.
  -> If an appid does not exist in the DB it should just be inserted.

- Write functions to update or insert based on presence in the DB.
  -> once it is determined that an appid is new it should go to insert_db()
  -> if the appid is already in the database the values should be compared and updated.

- Define column lengths to ensure compatability with mysql

- Add additional colums for tracking highest price, lowest price, average price. The current columns ( init_price, final_price ) can hold current price data.

- When an appid is discovered  to be invalid we should add it to a blacklist so we can reduce the web requests. This should be stored in a seperate db table.
