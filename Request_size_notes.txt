Requests have a maximum size limit.  The exact size isn't yet known.
Failures return null output (this is why we split the code in half in
commit a1bace3)

Requesting a game list returns JSON output that is 1490985 bytes long
(~1.4MB), so that's obviously okay (and could be shorter--the output
is pretty-printed).

The average length of a game name is 15.5 bytes long.

Price data is close-packed JSON.  Example: one success, one failure:
    {"10":{"success":true,"data":{"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":999,"final":999,"discount_percent":0}}},"7":{"success":false}}

JSON beginning delimiter:
    1   {

Successful record:
    N+2 "<id_int>"
    17  :{"success":true,
    53  "data":{"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":
    19  <initial_price_int>
    9   ,"final":
    N   <final_price_int>
    20  ,"discount_percent":
    N   <discount_int>
    3   }}}

Comma separator:
    1   ,
    
Failed size:
    N+2 "7"
    18  :{"success":false}

JSON end delimiter:
    1   }


Successful record size:
    104 bytes + length(id) + length(initial_price) + length(final_price + length(final_price)

Failed record size:
    20 + length(id) 

Punctuation size:
    2 + 1 * (number_of_records-1)

Total size:
    126 + length(id) + length(initial_price) + length(final_price + length(final_price) + (num_records -1 )

ID lengths average 5.5 bytes (round up to 6 bytes).  Most prices are 3 or 4 bytes long, and discounts are 1 or 2 bytes.

Thus, an "average" successful game record should be:
    126 + 5.5 + 3.5 + 1.5 = 136.5 bytes 

The largest block of data returned successfully so far is 17,081 bytes long.

That's ~124 full records every time, as a best-case scenario.
